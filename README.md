# Wi-Fi and Mobile Network Signal Strength Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes Wi-Fi and mobile network signal strengths across different wings of a building. Using data collected via a mobile app called *Signal Strength*, the project aims to visualize and understand the distribution and variation of network signal strength across the building, which can help in optimizing network placement.

## Data Collection

The data was collected using a mobile app that recorded signal strengths for Wi-Fi and mobile networks (e.g., 4G, 5G) at various points within the wings of the building. Each data point consists of:
- Wing (location within the building)
- Wi-Fi signal strength (in dBm)
- Mobile network signal strength (in dBm)

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were used to explore and analyze the data:
1. **Pair Plot**: To compare signal strengths for Wi-Fi and mobile networks.
2. **Stacked Bar Plot**: To show relative Wi-Fi and mobile network signal strengths across wings.
3. **Density Plot**: To visualize the distribution of signal strengths.
4. **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)**: To show the cumulative probability of signal strengths.
5. **Contour Plot**: To illustrate the spatial distribution of Wi-Fi signal strength across wings..
6. 

## Key Insights

- Wi-Fi and mobile network signals vary significantly across different wings of the building.
- Contour plots highlighted areas with weak signal strengths, suggesting where network optimizations (e.g., adding routers or boosters) are needed.
- The project provided actionable insights for optimizing network placement to improve coverage.
